## 2025-11-27 – Project Kickoff

**Time spent:** ~2–3 hours  

**Summary:**  
Today I officially started working on my exjobb project:  
“Real-Time Data Pipeline for Stockholm Traffic & Transit Analytics”.

Even though I submitted the project plan earlier, this is my 2025-11-27 start date.  
I feel it is a bit late to start, but I am confident that I can complete the project within the scheduled time and submit both the technical work and the report.
